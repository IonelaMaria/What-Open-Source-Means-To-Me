Open Source means for me a religious lifestyle. Why?
It is a fact that millions of intelligent people on Earth choose to help without
asking anything in return from developing an extremely strong community programmers 
and users of Open Source software. For me that means a particular form of religiosity 
that touches the very essence of religious life.

Requiring less and give more, to help selflessly support others who ask you, feel 
fulfilled by the fact that you belong to a community of people who think and act the 
same with you - these are fundamental aspects of religion. Superstition, ceremony, 
habit to perform certain religious gestures laden seem insignificant just a shell of religious living.
